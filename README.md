# Content-Based Recommender System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a **Content-Based Recommender System**. It is designed to recommend movies based on their attributes and user preferences.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to the ones a user has already liked based on content attributes.
- **Data Analysis**: Includes steps to preprocess and analyze movie data.
- **Similarity Metrics**: Utilizes similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) to rank recommendations.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikastomar0010/movie-recommender-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd movie-recommender-system
```

3. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Movie_Recommender_System.ipynb
```

4. Run the notebook cells to execute the code.

## Usage
- Load your dataset of movies (ensure the dataset includes features such as genres, keywords, etc.).
- Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data and compute recommendations.
- Modify the similarity metrics or features as needed to customize the recommendations.

## Dataset
This notebook assumes the presence of a dataset with relevant movie attributes. Example columns:
- Movie title
- Genres
- Keywords
- Overview

If no dataset is provided, you may need to acquire one, such as from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or other open movie databases.

## Results
The notebook outputs:
- Recommended movies based on a selected input movie.
- Insights into how the recommendations are calculated.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## Acknowledgments
- Inspiration for this project comes from various tutorials and research on recommender systems.
- Libraries such as `scikit-learn` make similarity computation seamless and efficient.
